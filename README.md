# UdpClientC-
Receiving and sending data with udp using C#

Trying to make real-time video streaming with udp. This is what I did so far. Code contains functions which connects to desired IP address and port number, and gets data from the IpEndPoint.

**Notes about the code**
Since udp is a connectionless protocol type unlike TCP/IP, the received data needs to be optimized and organized in a meaningful way. Both sender and client needs to encode and decode in the same way like a mirror. This code is basic there is no optimizing and organizing, yet. Because the project that I am working on is kind of specific and not working properly at this point. 

_I will try to update as the project goes on and develops._
